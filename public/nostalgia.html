    <h1>My favorite nostalgic games I played in my childhood</h1>
    <hr />

    <h2>Project IGI and IGI 2 - Covert Strike</h2>
    <p>
      I remember playing this game for the first time with my cousin at his
      house. Good old memories!
    </p>
    <p>Infact, I played this game recently again like one year ago on my PC.</p>

    <h2>Road Rash - Windows XP</h2>
    <p>
      This has to be everyone's favorite racing arcade game, those fighting and
      crashing to get ahead of CPUs.
    </p>
    <p>Oh man!, those feeling can't be explained</p>

    <h2>GTA Vice City</h2>
    <p>
      Well this was during my middle and high school days, but roaming around
      the city, stealing others cars and bikes was something.
    </p>
    <p>And especially entering cheat codes, BIG BANG and boom.</p>

    <h2>
      and list goes on... there were so many other games that I cant remember
      but it was fun at that moment
    </h2>
